Priming Site Predictor which uses a seed-and-extension algorithm (*RIblast*:https://github.com/fukunagatsu/RIblast) to *Predict Priming Sites* of oligo dT primers in target sequences. Further, *Binding Energies* are calculated and classified with a threshold value. Additionally, the binding sites are associated with *Binding Probabilities* and stored in a *GTF File* for further processes.
